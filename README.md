# Continual-Learning2
An experiment of Continual Learning to see if it is possible to train a model on a dataset and then retrain it on another without loss of memory on the first one
I used the Fisher Information Matrix to perform EWC loss.
The aim is training a model with the ability on predict cardiac disease on a dataframe of a certain Hospital A, and the retain it on the cases from two differnt Hospitals B and C, without loss of ability on the A-task.
